# Teleradiology Platform

A lightweight teleradiology web app for receiving DICOM ZIPs, assigning them to radiologists, and delivering diagnostic reports. Built with **Laravel**, **Blade**, and **Tailwind CSS**.

## Quick summary
- Upload DICOM ZIPs (customers & hospital uploaders) as batches.
- Admin sets prices (based on file type), confirms batches and assigns them to readers.
- Readers download batches, create text/pdf reports.
- File types CRUD (name, anatomy, price_per_file).
- Hospital billing and per-upload quoting.
- Roles & permissions via **spatie/laravel-permission**.

---
